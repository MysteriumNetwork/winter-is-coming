# Secret Whispering. Game "Winter is coming"

Hey, Network Developer, we're challenging you to encrypt war messages!

## Requirements:
Build a protocol, which encrypts IP packets.

- Archers are fighting against zombies by [game rules](../README.md#game-rules)
- But _The White Walker_ is sniffing Archer's shots and coordinating Zombie's movement
- Create tunnel which encapsulates IP packets e.g. tun/tap
- Tunnel should encrypt all data
- Redirect all game messages to this encrypted tunnel

Task difficulty is for 1-2 days
- Choose platform for problem solving
- Choose your own technology (Golang or C++ are preferred)
- Only solve the problems scoped in the requirements. Don't implement logic of Game engine
- Share code on VCS and send a link to jobs@mysterium.network

Bonus points for:
- Demonstrated clean code with good readability
