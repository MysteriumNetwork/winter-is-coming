# Talk to Zombies. Game "Winter is coming"

Hey, Backend Engineer, we'd like you to build a simple game engine! :)

## Requirements
Build a Server which hosts a [game](../README.md#game-rules) and game participant (Client) can play via bidirectional Communication Channel 

- Fulfill specification - implement game engine by [Communication Channel specification](#communication-channel-specification) 
- Concentration - only solve the requirements and don't spent more than 1 workday
- Language agnostic - choose a language for this problem solving (we love Golang or any readable code)
- Clean code - demonstrate your most readable code
- Design patterns - demonstrate your design skills (SOLID, KISS, DRY etc.)
- Testing - demonstrate creepy love for tests, it's totally ok
- We can easily start your game Server and play
- Share code on VCS and send a link to jobs@mysterium.network

### Communication Channel specification
- As a Client I can join and interact with Server through Communication Channel
- Dont create a Client yet. Anyway your chosen protocol will be testable with *telnet*, *curl*, *Postman* etc.
and start a game after joining
- As a Client I can start a game
- When game is started Server creates new board and spawns new Zombie
- When game is started Server announces Zombieâ€™s coordinates every 2 seconds
- As a Client I can send coordinates of the my shot
- As a Client I would like to know if my shot was accurate

### Communication Channel example
```
# Client starts new game for his Player:
START {player}
START john
```

```
# Server announces Zombie's coordinates as he moves:
WALK {zombie} {x} {y}
WALK night-king 0 0
WALK night-king 0 1
WALK night-king 1 1
WALK night-king 1 2
WALK night-king 1 3
...
...
# until moving stops
```

```
# Client sends Player's shoot coordinates
SHOOT {x} {y}
SHOOT 1 3
```

```
# Server responds with shot's result
BOOM {player} {points} [{zombie}]
BOOM john 0
BOOM john 1 night-king
```

### Bonus points for (only when requirements fulfilled)
- Parallelism problem - unlimited Clients can play simultaneous games at once
- Concurrency problem - several Clients can join same game, first good shoot wins
- Cross-platform problem - your friends are able to host a Server on their personal machines
- Peer-to-peer problem - you can connect to your friend's server and play from your home
- Critical thinking - pick a solution/library for bidirectional Communication Channel so that it fits game requirements. Or implement any creative solution for messaging
