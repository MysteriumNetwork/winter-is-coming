# Wall Orbuculum. Game "Winter is coming"

Hey, Application Engineer, we would like you to create game client for existing game server ðŸ˜ƒ

## Task

Letâ€™s say you have some hipster friends who only use Mac Books and iPhones and are very picky about native user experience.
But they heard about this awesome [game](../README.md#game-rules) and want to try it out.

You will have to implement desktop or mobile application, which should fulfill [UI specification](#ui-specification).

Application should communicate to server, see [Communication Channel specification](Talk_to_Zombies.md#communication-channel-specification).
Server is running at `winter-is-coming.mysterium.network` on port `8765`.

This task is *technology agnostic* (we love any readable code) - choose a technology which you know well and which seems appropriate for this task. 

## Requirements

Your task will be evaluated on these criteria:

- Implementation correctness of functionality described in task description
- Concentration - only solve the requirements and don't spent more than 2 workdays
- Clean code - demonstrate your most readable code
- Design patterns - demonstrate your design skills (SOLID, KISS, DRY etc.)
- Testing - demonstrate testing skills by writing automated tests for your solution (creepy love for tests is totally fine)
- We can easily run your application and try it out

### UI specification
- As a Player I can connect to game Server at `winter-is-coming.mysterium.network` on port `8765`
- As a Player I can start new game
- As a Player I can see how zombie moving around game field
- As a Player I can shoot zombie
- As a Player I can understand if I hit zombie
