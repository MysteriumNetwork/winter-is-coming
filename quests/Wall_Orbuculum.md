# Wall Orbuculum. Game "Winter is coming"

Hey, Application Engineer, we would like you to create User Interface for a game :)

## Requirements
Letâ€™s say you have some hipster friends who only use Mac Books and iPhones and are very picky about native user experience.
But they heard about this awesome [game](../README.md#game-rules) and want to try it out.

- Fulfill specification - implement desktop or mobile application by [UI specification](#ui-specification)
- Integrate to Server - implement Client by [Communication Channel specification](Talk_to_Zombies.md#communication-channel-specification)
- Concentration - only solve the requirements and don't spent more than 2 workdays
- Technology agnostic - choose a technology for this problem solving (we love any readable code)
- Clean code - demonstrate your most readable code
- Design patterns - demonstrate your design skills (SOLID, KISS, DRY etc.)
- Testing - demonstrate testing skills by writing automated tests for your solution (creepy love for tests is totally fine)
- We can easily run your application and try it out
- Share code on VCS and send a link to jobs@mysterium.network

### UI specification
- As a Player I can connect to game Server at `winter-is-coming.mysterium.network` on port `8765`
- As a Player I can start new game
- As a Player I can see how zombie moving around game field
- As a Player I can shoot zombie
- As a Player I can understand if I hit zombie
